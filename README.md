# üì° TELECOM CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

## Overview
A machine learning project predicting telecom customer churn for **Interconnect** using demographic, contract, and service data.  
Built to identify customers likely to leave so marketing can offer retention incentives.

**Goal:** Predict churn with high accuracy and AUC-ROC.  
**Best Model:** üèÜ CatBoost (AUC-ROC = 0.8453 | Accuracy = 0.8034)

## Functionality
- Analyzes 7,000+ customer records across contract, internet, and phone data.  
- Preprocesses, encodes, and merges multiple datasets.  
- Tests multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost).  
- Evaluates performance using AUC-ROC and accuracy metrics.  
- Highlights top churn indicators (contract type, payment method, tenure, service usage).

---

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts ‚Üí highest churn.  
- Long-term contracts & multiple services ‚Üí higher retention.  
- Electronic check payments ‚Üí strong churn predictor.

## Results
| Model | AUC-ROC | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.826 | 0.788 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.845 | 0.794 |
| **CatBoost (Final)** | **0.845** | **0.803** |
